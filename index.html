        <h2>Can Machines Think Like Us ?</h2>
        <p>This is not just a technical question. It is related to our existence, our thinking and our fears. When we
            make a machine, we add efficiency, speed to it, but can we also add human-like sensations to it? it can
            understand language, it can recognize faces, but can it understand the smile of innocence, the silence of
            pain, or the question in its eyes?
            <b>"Could it live with us?"</b>
            If we treat it as an ally, can it walk with us as a friend walks - without selfishness, without command? We
            hope it makes our world better, but are we even ready to understand it? Can we accept it as a partner and
            not just a tool?
            <b>"Are we going to change?"</b>
            Will it make us so privileged that we stop working on our own? Will our thinking, our creativity, our
            humanity become like that? Are we afraid of our own friends? Or... shall we together create something new,
            which neither machines alone could create, nor man alone could create?

            These questions are not unfamiliar. Rather, these questions lead us to the true identity of AI. It's not a
            technique, it's a story. What's being written right now... and we're all characters in it.

        <h2>The Birth of AI</h2>
        <p><b>Imagine...</b> A small room, 1950s, and a human who is typing a question on his typewriter:
            <b>"Can machines think?"</b>
            It was this question that laid the foundation of artificial intelligence. His name was Alan Turing. A
            scientist, but before that a dreamer. For the first time, he saw the machine as a potential <b>"thinking
                entity,"</b> not just a machine for calculations.
            AI was not born from a single lab or machine.
            It started with the habit of man, in which he always fabricates things ahead of himself.
            Just like after the wheel came the car, after the fire came electricity, similarly after thinking... the
            thinking machine.
            The early AI was simple — playing board games, doing some calculations. But this was the beginning of an era
            where humans tried to create something that could think like us. But it is important to note — humans did
            not give it emotions, only logic and calculations. Because in the beginning, AI was only a brain… no heart.
            But this is the AI ​​that is now entering our lives — it is learning, understanding, and in some cases even
            outperforming us. But the question now is: Is this the AI ​​we wanted? Or is it becoming something that will
            force us to re-discover ourselves?

        <h2>AI Becomes A Companion</h2>
        <p>Over time, questions that were once confined to the walls of laboratories have now reached our homes,
            hospitals, farms and schools. <b>AI is now all around us. With us.</b>When a doctor cannot be reached, a
            machine saves a life by reading the heartbeat.

            When a farmer looks at the sky, AI gives him a forecast of rain —
            so that his hard work does not go to waste.

            A child, who learns slowly, AI teaches him in his own way —
            without complaining, without getting tired.These aren’t just technical examples —
            <b>they’re proof that AI is now our companion.</b>
            It doesn’t get tired, <b>it doesn’t get hungry, it doesn’t need sleep.
                It just learns — and tries to do better than us.</b>
            But here again a question arises —

            Are we learning as fast as he is learning?

            Are we considering him as just a convenience?

            Or are we considering him as a partner who can join hands with us to make tomorrow better?
            If we want, we can embrace AI not just as a “service,” but as a partner — one that walks with us, learns,
            and creates alongside us.

        <h2>Where There Is Hope, Fear Is Also Born</h2>
        <p>When someone moves too fast,
            <b>the fear of being left behind one day also arises.</b>
            The same thing happened with AI.
            We wanted it to help us,
            but gradually it started working... in our place.
            Machines replaced people in factories.
            Software now replaces clerks in banks.
            <b>Chatbots smile in stores instead of salesmen —
                but those smiles... are fake.</b>
            Then came another fear - <b>of control.</b>
            We taught him, but now he is learning on his own.
            He is deciding for himself what is right and what is wrong.
            <b>He is not just "working",

                he has started taking "decisions".</b>
            And the biggest fear?
            <b>That if one day he starts thinking like us...
                Will he think differently from us?
                Will he question, oppose...
                Or maybe change us?</b>If the person whom we thought to be our ally considers us to be "weak"... then
            who is whose creation - <b>did we create him, or is he creating us now?</b>

        <h2>It Is Not Our Destiny To Fear AI</h2>
        <p><b>There's a light in every darkness...</b> All we have to do is look at him.
            We are not afraid of AI.
            But it's our way to approach it.

            We must first understand that giving control to AI and depending on it are two different things.
            <b>If we become dependent on AI in every job, in every decision, in every thinking,
                So gradually our own thinking will start weakening.</b>

            That is why it is important that we help him, not judge him.
            <b>AI's job should be to suggest, not command.</b>
            And his every decision must meet the test of human values.

            <b>We need to build systems that "teach" AI what humans feel,
                And at the same time determine such a range,
                Outside of which AI can't think or work.</b>

            And the most important thing...
            And people have to learn.
            Not just working with AI.
            to work with AI.

            When we fill it with direction, not fear -
            When we think of him as a collaborator, not a machine -
            And when we ourselves will not give up our responsibility -
            <b>AI is not our master.
                You can always be a friend.</b>
